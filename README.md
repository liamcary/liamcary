ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @liamcary. I'm an Australian living and working in Singapore as Lead Game Programmer at ArcadeXR. We're bringing the arcade experience to new entertainment channels, like VR (Arcade Legend) and web platforms (Arcade.Online). Prior to ArcadeXR I spent 10 years at LAI Games designing and developing original arcade games and other arcade-related projects. 

I've been developing games professionally in Unity3D since 2011 and I have a Bachelor of Interactive Entertainment with a major in Games Programming. I'm passionate about game feel, clean coding styles, project architecture, automating and continuously improving processes and learning new technologies. My experience covers just about all aspects of a game's development, having completed projects as a solo programmer as well as working in teams and leading development teams. I have extensive experience in gameplay, physics, tools, VR, UI, shaders and multiplayer programming. 

At LAI Games, our arcade games had a lot of extra systems running behind the scenes, so I also have experience in other technologies, such as:
- Server development for online game backends (ASP.NET, Razor, HTML, REST APIs, MySQL, Redis)
- Deployment to, and maintenance of, AWS services (EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, RDS, S3, Elasticache)
- Plugin development for interfacing with bespoke arcade input/output hardware (C++ DLLs, Win32 APIs)
- Standalone programs running in the background for platform stability, automatic software updates, and additional features outside of the game software (.NET programs, Windows Services, batch and powershell scripts, C++ Direct2D programs, etc) 
- Custom windows image development and automation of image creation so that arcade cabinets boot directly into the game and prevent windows popups, etc (Windows ICD, DISM, ImageX, WinPE, Powershell)
- Build automation (Gitlab CI, Jenkins, custom C# build tools within Unity)
- and more...

Some of the projects i've worked on at LAI Games include:
- Arcade Legend (Lead Game Programmer): Virtual reality multiplayer arcade management/simulator for Steam and Meta Quest.
- Outnumbered (Lead Game Programmer, Server Programmer): Light gun rail shooter arcade game with Android/iOS companion apps for recording progress and customising guns.
- Color Match (Sole Game Programmer): Prize redemption arcade game with 4 different cabinet configurations.
- PiÃ±ata (Sole Game Programmer): Childrens PiÃ±ata bashing arcade game that can award tickets or vend candy.
- Snapshot 2 (Back end systems and support): A standalone photo booth featuring multiple camera angles, modes and cabinet configurations. 
- HYPERshoot (Game Design): Arcade basketball game featuring an innovate animated light tunnel.
- Let's Bounce (Game Design): Arcade midway game where you aim to bounce 20 ping pong balls and hit all 45 illuminated tiles.

I also previously worked at an Australian mobile games studio called Bifrost Studios and worked on these titles:
- Zombie Juice (Junior Programmer): An Android and iOS game where you use swipe gestures to slice waves of zombies.
- Valkyrie (Junior Programmer): A level-based first person runner for Android and iOS.

I also have a keen interest in other aspects of game development, like game design and marketing. I keep my finger on the pulse of the industry and share with my team the latest trends in game design and marketing, changes and opportunities of different platforms, production processes that have proved successful at other studios, etc.
